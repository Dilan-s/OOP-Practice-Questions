The file PrintBook creates a set (i.e. distinct) books;
The book then adds 2 books "C++" and "Haskell" to the set;
The book "Java" is not added to the set as it is regarded as the same object as the "C++" in the set
  as the ISBN value is the same;
The name of "C++" is then changed to "New C++ book", which is automatically changed in the set
  due to it pointing at the same object;
Then all books are printed in the format ***title + (ISBN:  + isbn + )***
